<h1>about</h1>

<p>If you're looking for my resume, it's <a href="../resume/resume.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're wondering if the "design" of this website is intentional, I can assure you
    <a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/">that</a>
    <a href="https://handmade.network/manifesto">it</a>
    <a href="http://www.graficaobscura.com/future/futnotes.html">most</a>
    <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">certainly</a>
    <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">is</a>.</p>
<p>I happily live a
    <a href="https://kmandla.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/howto-switch-to-a-console-lifestyle/">command line lifestyle</a>
    and I firmly believe that this choice greatly enriches my computational life, although my commitment is more to
    programmability and a keyboard-driven workflow than it is to the rejection of non-textual pixels (but this site does
    look awesome in <a href="http://elinks.or.cz/">elinks</a> though).</p>
<p>I came of age as a programmer in a REPL-driven, clojure infatuated, haze, but have since come to appreciate the value
    of static type systems as a valuable tool in the programmer's arsenal.</p>
<p>My computational life is driven by two main questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What can computers do?</li>
    <li>What is the coolest thing I can do with a computer?</li>
</ul>
