<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>BestBuy (via AIM)</h3>

<h4>ML Engineer -- August 2020 to Present</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Designed, implemented, and delivered automated Code Standards for the team,
        including adding and enforcing type signatures via mypy,
        automatic code formatting via isort and black,
        style checking via pycodestyle,
        complexity analysis via radon,
        and the continuous running of an extensive and ever-growing test suite via pytest,
        runnable anywhere via a single, simple make target,
        all with the goal of asymptotically approaching "true continuousness" in the integration of change and the delivery of value
        (mypy, isort, black, pycodestyle, radon, pytest, make)
    </li>
    <li>Designed, prototyped, and delivered continuous ML model deployment
        (Kubeflow, Jenkins, Google Cloud Build, ArgoCD, Seldon)
    </li>
    <li>Assisted, primarily in an MLOps capacity, in the shipping of the first live endpoint
        backed by an ML model used in production at BestBuy,
        which serves as a means of re-ranking recommendations
        (Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Seldon)
    </li>
    <li>Introduced, integrated, maintained, and advocated for the use of a Monorepo,
        leveraging Bazel for fast, correct, granular builds,
        to accelerate our rate and increase our breadth of change and our collective ease of code reuse and sharing
        (Bazel, Make, BitBucket, Jenkins, GitHub)
    </li>
    <li>Inspired, informed, and entertained via regular, passionate, detailed, technical demos of working software</li>
    <li>Led by example in inciting cultural change pertaining to engineering rigor,
        championing the extensive, expressive use of type annotations,
        a relentless empiricism driven by tests in the designing of systems and their constituent components,
        and an offloading of "the boring stuff" to automation written in a manner adhering to, demonstrating the value of,
        and driving forward those very means of rigor
        (mypy, pytest, ScalaTest, make)
    </li>
    <li>Performed a wide variety of Data Engineering tasks
        on large-scale datasets in excess of 100+ billion rows (20+ TB)
        (Dataflow, Kubeflow, BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage (GCS))
    </li>
    <li>Creatively mitigated legacy data-quality issues
        by graph-building via value-tracing to make sense of large, undocumented piles of legacy data,
        reverse engineering a more comprehensive schema,
        creating a tangible representation of their connectedness in graph form,
        enabling better data accessibility, comprehensibility, and usability
        (Mypy, Pytest, BigQuery, Dataflow, Kubeflow)
    </li>
    <li>Ingeniously leveraged parameterized pytest tests that walk the abstract syntax tree
        to check all functions for various properties we would like to enforce per our agreed-upon
        and regularly revised code standards, effectively enforcing constraints on functions per our guidelines as they are written
        (pytest, mypy)
    </li>
    <li>Demonstrated a rigorous commitment to Types and Tests,
        illustrating their incredible value as augmentations of human intellect and power,
        highlighting their unique ability to decrease costs for entering and maintaining "flow",
        the happiest and most productive state in which every programmer takes great delight :)
    </li>
    <li>Authored and maintained our setup scripts to entirely automate the creation of a functional local development environment,
        reducing down to a simple command, literally `make magic`, that does all-the-things,
        from nothing up through locally running and passing tests,
        all the way to individual kubernetes clusters (hosted in GCP (GKE)) in which ML Scientists can iterate at scale with
        whatever hardware is best suited to the task at hand
        (Make, Ansible, Bash)
    </li>
</ul>
