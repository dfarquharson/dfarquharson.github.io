<h1>The Ends Of Quality</h1>

<p>
The revolution in connected "smart materials" and other forms of ubiquitous computing
that promise to revolutionize the human experience must necessarily coincide with 
a revolution in software quality and reliability. I'd argue the means of such a revolution in quality
are available today by way of industrial application of academic advancement in formal methods
and other proof mechanisms such as type systems. Haskell, Idris, Agda, Coq, TLA+, and others must be
rigorously and inventively applied in industry in order for us to begin to realize our destiny
in what today is only a dream world: flying, teleporation, instant physical manifestation of the contents
of your imagination. These are just some of the, admittedly grandiose, but nonetheless plausible, potentialities
of a world of such ubiquitous computing. This is a new world; a world in which all matter is programmable;
a world in which the current models and systems do not apply.
</p>

<p>
This is why I'm dedicating my career to the novel application of methods to increase the quality
and reliability of software; a world where dreams can literally become reality.
</p>

<p>
Quality begets new realities by way of providing new footing on which to stand from which we can reach higher.
</p>

<p>
I'm not there yet, but from this day forward I'd like to, personally and collectively, be closer to this potential
reality tomorrow than we are today; closer today than we were yesterday.
</p>

<p>
If I may be so bold, in light of these tenuously proclaimed potentialities, I'd like to claim, in the spirit of Alan Kay,
that the computer revolution has not yet occurred. The greatest potential of these mechanisms are today but a faint possibility
on the horizon. In my estimation, taking steps toward increased software quality are steps in this incredible direction.
I invite you to join me on this journey toward quality software that will move us toward a future that we can be proud
of having been a part of creating.
