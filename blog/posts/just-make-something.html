<h1>Just Make Something</h1>

<p style="text-indent: 1em">In the primordial ooze that was the original conception of this talk, I had planned on
  singing the praises of static typing, showing how we can encode assertions about our program into types using our type
  system and then have our compiler ensure that we have remained consistent in those assertions. This is truly an
  amazing super power, and it is a great use of computers; giving them a recipe and having them go about making sure it
  is followed is where they shine. However, this, again, is not the silver bullet you’re looking for. Just because we
  have the ability to make verifiable assertions about our program at compile time does not mean that we are suddenly
  more capable of solving problems, nor that we’re actually solving the right ones, nor that we’re even doing anything
  meaningful at all. Types are great, and they can make it easier to reason about a program or design a solution to a
  problem and enable great tooling and provide meaningful, necessarily synchronized, documentation for ourselves and our
  coworkers, but they still aren’t enough. I’ve spent years of my life agonizing over the static vs dynamic typing
  debate, and that has been wasted time. Just think of the amazing programs I could have created over that time instead.
  I don’t mean to say that I am some exceptional programmer, I’m merely making a statement of fact related to time
  investment. I could have played with graphics programming, messed around with networked multiplayer games, built
  command line tools, guis, contributed to free software, and so many other things. I could have actually made stuff.
  But instead of all that, I read blog posts, comment threads, and watched youtube videos debating the merits of type
  systems. I learned things from that, and I shouldn’t completely write those learnings off, but, ultimately, that was
  just a means of procrastination for me. It was a means of staving off the fear, the utter terror, of actually making
  something and having that something be a piece of shit. So instead of embracing that reality and making a bunch of
  shit things, I sought “the one true way” to make things, so that I would never make shitty things. But the only way to
  make good things remains painfully simple: make a bunch of progressively less shitty things, and maybe, just maybe, if
  you’re really lucky, every once in a while, you might make something that’s actually good.</p>

<p>Your technology choices don’t matter.<br>
  Your arbitrary opinions don’t matter.<br>
  Your fickle beliefs don’t matter.<br>
  All that matters is that you make something; something cool; something fun; something useful; something
  worthwhile.<br>
  It doesn’t matter if that thing uses the right style, the right best practices, the right type system, the right
  language, the right architecture, no, all that matters is that you’ve made something.<br>
  So just make something.<br>
  We spend way too much time studying fashions and trends and trying to be hip.<br>
  That is a waste of fucking time.<br>
  Stop that shit.<br>
  Just make something.<br>
  Anything.<br>
  Make it work well.<br>
  Make it solve problems.<br>
  Make it something you’d want to use.<br>
  And have fun making it.<br>
  Rediscover the joy of making things.<br>
  Rediscover the passion for your craft.<br>
  Rediscover the wonder at the infinite expanse of the computable.<br>
  Whenever you’re in doubt about what you should do; just make something.<br>
  Whenever you’re not sure where you should go; just make something.<br>
  Whenever you’re stuck, uninspired, or lacking in confidence; just make something.<br>
  Let’s make this a place where people make things.<br>
  Let’s make this a place where we show off the things we make to each other.<br>
  Let’s make this a place where we convivially compete with each other to make the coolest thing.<br>
  Let’s make this a place where we inspire each other, not by words, but by deeds.<br>
  Let’s make this a place worth being.<br>
  Talk is cheap.<br>
  This is my last tech talk of this nature.<br> <!-- But not my last blog post! -->
  Any future tech talks I give will be live demos of working software.<br>
  Because that is the only thing that matters.<br>
  That is why I do what I do.<br>
  That is what gives me enduring joy.<br>
  The silver bullet is hard work.<br>
  The silver bullet is making things.<br>
  You don’t find the silver bullet; you make it.</p>
