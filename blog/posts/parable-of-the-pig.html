<h1>Parable of the Pig</h1>

<p>One day, a group of enterprising young individuals happened upon a great business idea: they were going to design a
    pig that pooped gold! Now, it isn’t entirely fair to say that they came up with this idea all on their own, for the
    spirit of the times was very much to take older means of producing precious metals and provide pig-based services as
    a replacement, due to the obvious convenience of simply having to pay to use a pig for this service rather than
    having to staff a large warehouse full of custom-trained alchemists or to breed your own pigs for this purpose. The
    challenge, however, is that not all people wanted the exact same precious metals produced, and not all people were
    able to provide the same input to this pig’s precious-metals-producing gastrointestinal system. The magic, then,
    became to augment and adapt this pig’s innards to produce the desired, varied, and potentially arbitrary precious
    metals given equally variable and potentially arbitrary input.</p>

<p>And so the owners began employing alchemists to this end, people with varying degrees of experience and skill, but
    they did the best they could with what they had. That was a time of great pig-based gastrointestinal
    experimentation, a veritable fecal gold rush. The market was hot for Pig Oriented Opulence Production Services,
    known colloquially as POOPS, and so the race was on. Like many successful businesses, our heroes knew that speed was
    of the essence in capturing large chunks of the POOPS market, and corners would have to be cut in quality in order
    to accept the broadest quantity of inputs to produce the broadest quantity of outputs in the shortest possible time.
    Some alchemists protested, citing quality and consistency concerns, knowing full well that such unconstrained
    organic growth can lead to swine cancer. Ownership, wisely, accepted this risk knowing full well that engineering
    cancer-resistant-gastrointestinally-augmented-precious-metal-producing pigs would put them behind in this ravenous
    market, hoping that the field of swine oncology would keep up with the advances in gastrointestinal pig augmentation
    when the time came for serious medical intervention. This was not a decision made out of malice or incompetence, but
    rather a calculated risk optimizing for that most critical of metrics: survival.</p>

<p>These decisions worked very much in ownership’s favor, and soon our heroes were buying up smaller POOPS shops and
    adding acquired customizations to their own pig’s gastrointestinal piping. These acquisitions provided not only pigs
    that would be stripped down for parts, but also more alchemists, some with wildly different philosophies about how
    proper POOPS should be crafted. It seems to be the nature of immature alchemists, and doubly so for alchemical
    overseers, to scoff at previous alchemical efforts, loudly and insistently proclaiming that no progress can be made
    without first discarding and recreating the existing concoctions in “the right way”. Most often these proclamations
    are made without any earnest attempt to deeply comprehend the existing work, and it is often merely a knee-jerk
    reaction to a single offensive surface-level trait. At times, rather than working through their disagreements and
    forging some sort of compromise, the disagreeing factions agreed to disagree and created separate parallel systems
    that performed similar, but subtly different, processing. And so the pig continued to grow, and concerns continued
    to mount among some of the alchemists about how they could hope to manage such unconstrained growth. “Surely this
    pig will get swine cancer soon!”, they proclaimed. Ownership, however, remained unperturbed, for the growth rate of
    the business showed no signs of stopping. They knew that they had cut some corners in the name of short term
    success, but what reasonable alternative was there? What way is “the right way” other than that which the market
    rewards? Surely a cancerous pig wouldn’t be producing returns of this magnitude. Customers were happy. The pig was
    working. Things were great. Until they weren’t.</p>

<p>The POOPS market began to stabilize, and our heroes sat atop the heap. Demand for POOPS was higher than ever, and
    yet, growth began to slow. “What is wrong with this pig?!”, ownership demanded. With great haste, they gathered the
    leading alchemists in the organization and insisted on an explanation. Much to ownership’s chagrin, consensus eluded
    the alchemists. Some claimed that the pig was terminally ill, and needed wholesale replacement. Others that there
    was nothing wrong with the pig at all, and business as usual would lead to renewed success. Others merely complained
    about the wrongdoings of past alchemists, offering little substance on the matters of either diagnosing or improving
    things. Disagreement stewed; ownership was frustrated. However, as the market for POOPS themselves began to congeal,
    markets for the philosophy and process of proper POOPS construction were exploding. One couldn’t walk 5 steps
    without bumping into some failed alchemist who had recently reimagined themselves into a self-spun POOPS process
    guru. Surely it was here, in the realm of independent experts and seasoned POOPS consultancies that we would find
    some answers. “May I take a look at your pig?”, the consultants inquired. “OH DEITY!”, they exclaimed. “We know
    PRECISELY why interest in your pig is waning”, they declared. “That lipstick on your pig is ENTIRELY out of fashion!
    This was the sort of lipstick that people were putting on pigs YEARS ago. You simply MUST get with the times and
    invest in MODERN lipstick.” And so ownership took them at their word, for they surely exhibited an air of certainty
    about their claims. The investment was made in modern lipstick and, I must admit, it looked quite nice. Our pig
    looked shiny and new, yet growth continued to plateau. With internal disagreement still the status quo for the
    alchemists, ownership again sought external assistance. Unfortunately for ownership, frustration only begat further
    frustration down this path. These third parties only served to further muddy the waters, cost exorbitant sums, and
    either provide unactionable pontifications on reinvention or a restatement of problems of which we were already
    aware. Answers wouldn’t come easy, or so it seemed.</p>

<p>Ownership again demanded solutions from its chief alchemists. This time, as there had been some turnover in their
    ranks, there was agreement among them. “This is madness!”, they exclaimed. “We can’t keep supporting arbitrary
    inputs and outputs on our pig! Let’s force everyone to feed our pig oats with a hint of maple and brown sugar. This
    enforces all fecal output to have exactly the same chemical composition, Au-197, the stable gold isotope. This makes
    our job so much easier! Everyone will be so happy!” But everyone wasn’t happy. Now those incapable of either
    producing the required input or consuming the enforced output needed adapters on either end of the pig. This solved
    no problems, and served only to entirely reject the value proposition of the pig in the first place, that of being a
    universal input to precious-metal output converter.</p>

<p>These new lead alchemists, however, remained optimistic. They were an admittedly brilliant group of individuals more
    than capable of producing all kinds of esoteric gastrointestinal pig alchemy, and one would certainly hope so
    considering their price tag. They became convinced that the most reasonable path forward was to rearrange all the
    parts of the pig. After all, some of the greatest alchemists in the POOPS arena had been deeply invested in the
    rising trend of POOPS orchestration frameworks. Surely our problem fell in this same domain. Furthermore, such
    rearrangement is challenging and engaging technical work, and can therefore be appreciated as such, for what
    self-respecting alchemist does not value a technical challenge? However, this ultimately did little for the state of
    the pig as the parts themselves remained exactly the same. Ignoring the reality that the actual parts needed
    maintenance only seemed to defer the inevitable.</p>

<p>Befuddled, the alchemists began to soften in their stances. They began to ask themselves anew about how they might be
    able to salvage this pig. Might it be the case that with the pruning of some vestigial parts, and maintenance of
    others that had fallen into disrepair, that the pig could continue to grow? The realization was dawning on them that
    there was some strange sort of beauty in the functionality of the pig, one that needed to be nurtured rather than
    destroyed, for the pig had largely succeeded to this point in fulfilling its purpose, with effort, as an arbitrary
    converter of input to output. Careful, considered surgeries would be the path forward; a death by a thousand cuts
    would be forestalled by the mending of a thousand sutures. Excise the appendix. Drain the duodenum. Irradiate the
    ileum. Jiggle the jejunum. Unkink the colon. Clear out the cecum. And maybe, just maybe, this pig would begin to
    grow at rates heretofore unseen. This work would be hard and unglamorous, but vainglorious moonshots had produced
    nothing but failure.</p>

<p>This brings us to the present day. The final pages in the story of the pig remain unwritten; unactualized ephemeral
    potentialities, awaiting our reification into realities. Will the alchemists band together and put in the hard work
    necessary to keep the pig alive, possibly restoring it to renewed vigor and catalyzing unprecedented growth? Or
    instead will they continue to squabble amongst themselves, chasing trends, swapping snake oil, and squander the
    opportunity that is before them, in the misguided hope of replacing the pig? Surely all pigs must eventually die,
    but not all pigs must die of neglect or misdirected attention. For too long we have ignored or misunderstood the
    true problems with our pig, and we can afford to do so no longer. And so I implore you: do the hard work. Understand
    the system. Hold each other to higher standards. Make each other better. Time is short. Start now. Save the pig.</p>
