# Future Blog Ideas

## Speed Running
- programming speed run
- software usage speed run
- SPS Commerce making a functional setup speed run
- Stick to your commitments (don't bend to the arbitrary whims of others; emphasis on ARBITRARY whims of others. Do respond to proper argumentation.)

## The Anti-Ideology Ideology
- In favor of pragmatism
- Can be convinced of positions with better evidence/supporting data

## Actually Making Things
- JUnit/Java
- Web UIs
- Processing?

## Just Shut Up and Use an IDE
- They are awesome
- Reliable GoTo Declaration that just works out of the box is indispensable
- Tool integration is real nice (tools that aren't integrated can still be used, obviously)
- Can still use Vim key-bindings in most mature IDEs (IdeaVim ftw)
- Running tests is real easy (ctrl+shift+R inside of the test/class/package/whatever you want to run)
- Big thing I realized wasn't even related to IDEs
- Static Analysis tools often built-in, which is nice (but you really want to be able to run any sort of tool like that in CI)

## Static Types
- Just use them, they make you life and other people's lives better

## Operating Systems
- I use Windows at Home and Mac at Work and Linux on my servers, deal with it
- Being a zealot for a technology is fine, but you have to at least know a few cons before you start preaching it

## On Criticising Existing Systems
- Assume positive intention
- Critically inspect perceived "unnecessary complexity" or "over-engineering" before you make proclamations about them
  (Assume positive intention. What problems does that "complexity" solve? What problems does it introduce?
   Is the trade-off worth it?)
- Yes, re-invent the system, on the side, and then perhaps you'll realize why some of the initial design decisions were made
- Yes, refactor and otherwise introduce change, but focus on comprehension of existing system and back-filling of any missing tests first
- Introduce new techniques in `src/test` before introducing them to `src/main`
